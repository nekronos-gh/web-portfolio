# The Beginning

Hello internet! 
Wow, I am nervous as I am writing this. First time posting something more than a comment on a social media post.
I was just watching a compilation of gem5 from source, pretty boring to be honest, so I decided I could start writing my first blog post. 

I am Eduardo, a computer engineer currently sutying in Luxembourg (High Performance Computing Master). I was born and raised in Spain, in the Municipality of Madrid, but after finishing high-school I have had the change to live abroad a travel around. For now, I will be staying in Luxembourg until the end of the semester, but next year I will start the 3rd semester of my master in Sofia, Bulgaria.

## Why a blog?

I wanted a place to document things I learn along the way. Writing helps me think more clearly, and also its good to reflect if you really understand the concept. I am not planning to use any tipe of AI to write, neither I am going to review too much of what I write. This is for me, and if somebody finds this along the way, I hope it will be of use.

## My expectations

Here are some topics I plan to write about:

* Research notes and paper summaries
* Pet projects
* Thoughts
* Books, movies, music, ...
* Personal life

A diary basically.

I am not planning to be very consistent, but I know myself, and after some delta time in which progress is guaranteed, I will have enough text to train an LLM to replace me (just textually, I do not think LLMs will ever be able to replace my procastination abilities).

## My current state

I am quite busy right now, which I experiece as a very good thing. I am going to Cyprus in two weeks for a conference, where I will be one of the studen embassadors for the EUMaster 4HPC. I have prepared a presentation, which includes a UI for executing a TSP solver and showing the best path dynamically on a map. Sin the TSP solver that is running in the background is based on genetic programming, I will show the evolution of the algorithm over time give a initial set of points in a map. Here you can take a look at it [PGA‑TSP‑visualizer](https://github.com/nekronos-gh/PGA-TSP-visualizer). Basically, the UI shows a map where you are selecting a set of points through which a drone has to pass.

In three weeks I am attending WSOS (Winter School for Operating Systems) in Austria. This is the reason why I have also decided to start writing. I want to have a personal page to upload to my linkedin, to showcase projects and so. I did not want to have the blog section empty, so here it is. I will be going to WSOS where the head of my research deparment will be givin a talk. Its going to be fun, and I am expecting to meet a lot of nerds like me.

Not only these two "conferences" are keeping me busy. I am playing flag football on the Luxembourg Wolves team, I am climbing around 1 a week (does not feel enough), and of course, classes take a lot of my time.

Last semester I skipped too many classes because I did not like the coursework, but this semester I have more interesting classes, so I do not think I will skip as much. Now, I am going to try to enumerate and give a little description of each one of the classes I have:

    - Formal methods: using math to prove if a system is correct, which does not mean much by now.
    - High Perfomance Computer Architecture: from right above hardware to right below application software.
    - High Performance Data Visualization: convince people that you results are relevant because you are using cool graphics.
    - Big Data Analytics: take a database, make it distributed, and store every book written in human history.
    - Microkernel based systems: classic OS are too complicated, and we do not trust them, so lets make them much much more complicated so we can still not trust them.
    - Optimization: we will work on a optimization problem (Model, solver, heuristic, programming, ...) during the semester. I hope I join Pierre's problem.

Ok, I think I am done with writing for today. I have to say I enjoyed it. Now I should keep working on the gen5 compilation, which I bet my whole house it has broken in the middle for something stupid and I will have to restart from the beginning. In reality, I am going to push this commit, add a new project to my porfolio and a picture of me if I can (All vibe-coded of course, I am not going to waste valuable time on frontend).

Thanks for reading -- Written on VIM
